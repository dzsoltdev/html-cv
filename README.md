# This is an open source project to create an online CV

...so feel free to fork and use it to create your on site.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can find my live app [here](https://zsolt-dobak.web.app/)

## About the customization
You should only change the content in the Content.tsx to build your own CV.

All of the SVGs will be automatically converted and replaced with an img tag.

If you'd like to convert something into canvas, you should use the
'data-convert-to-canvas' data attribute on the given element.

You also can set up breaking points for the page breaking with adding the 
'data-breakpoint' data attribute on any element, which you'd like to give the 
possibility to be shifted to the next page.
